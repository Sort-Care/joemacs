;;; Commentary:

;; To use this feature simple eval (require 'figlet) type M-x figlet
;; and you will be asked for a string. If you use a prefix (C-u M-x
;; figlet) then you will be asked for a font.

;; Have a look at `figlet-comment', `figlet-figletify-region' and
;; `figlet-figletify-region-comment'.

;; Warning, leaving large ascii art text in your teams codebase might
;; cause an outbreak of physical violence.
